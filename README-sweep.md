# The optimal-profile corpus

A grid of optimal elytra pitch schedules, one file per cell, over
`(num_ticks, lambda, vy0, vz0)`.

Each file states the utility function and initial conditions it was optimized under, and its
claim is checkable by re-running the optimizer's own stopping test against the file alone:

```
sweep verify runs/corpus/vy+0.0000_vz+0.0000/n0300_lam+0.000000.pitches
```

How a schedule was reached is deliberately not recorded. Given `(v0, pitches)` the trajectory is
fully determined, so every derived quantity is recomputable and the optimality claim is
falsifiable without trusting the pipeline that produced it.

## The objective

```
KE = |v|^2 / (2 * GRAVITY)     PE = y     TE = KE + PE        (blocks)
J  = TE(s_n) + w * z_n                                        (terminal velocity free)
w  = lambda * Y_REF / Z_REF    Y_REF = 21.5   Z_REF = 330
```

`lambda` normalizes the reference cycle's 21.5 blocks of climb against its 330 blocks of
distance, so at `lambda = 1` the two terms are the same scale. Negative `lambda` punishes
distance, which is the elytra-parkour side and matters at least as much as the positive side.

Pitch is `f32` because the sim casts it to `f32`, so `f32` is the exact control alphabet -- the
text in the file is the schedule that will be flown, not a rounding of it.

## Degeneracy, and why stopping time is the regularizer

Polished to convergence, the exact objective genuinely prefers a schedule no human can fly. At
pitch 90 degrees `cos(lean_angle)` is zero, so lift vanishes *and* `look_hor_length` vanishes,
gating off both the descent-to-forward conversion and the turning term; bang-bang between "full
aero" and "no aero" beats any fixed pitch on the singular arc. This is not a convergence
failure: 200 passes reaches residual 9.4e-6, a real coordinate optimum.

**Total variation cannot detect it**, because a real flick is also a large move -- the cycle
drops to 0 and covers ~88 degrees in about six ticks. What separates them is whether
neighboring ticks move *together*. `lag1`, the lag-1 correlation of the per-tick changes, is
the statistic that does: the reference cycle reads +0.48, the same schedule polished 200 passes
reads -0.74, and the sign flip is the diagnosis. It is in every header.

Things that were tried and measured:

| lever | result |
|---|---|
| slew-rate limit | no. Any limit loose enough to keep the real flicks keeps the chatter. |
| per-tick pitch jitter | no. Held fixed it made chatter *worse* (TV 2406 -> 3493); resampled it cut TV 29% for 2.3 blocks of climb. The chattering end is pitch-insensitive -- `lift_force = cos^2(lean_angle)` is flat at 90 degrees. |
| initial-velocity jitter, polished hard | no. At 60 forced passes TV is 925, 871, 838, 826, 884 for sigma 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 -- flat across an 8x range, while `dz` falls monotonically 345 -> 337. |
| initial-velocity jitter, stopped early | **yes**, but only while stopped early -- which leaves the answer depending on when the optimizer was interrupted. Superseded. |
| stopping time | **yes**, and it was what bounded it before the curvature price. Same objection: the answer is wherever the polish was cut off. |
| l1 curvature price (`Rough::mu`) | **yes, and this is what is used now.** A price rather than a stopping rule, so the polish runs to convergence and the result is a real optimum that `verify` can re-check from the header. `runs/atlas` at `mu = 1e-4`, `runs/antichatter` at `mu = 1e-3`, both with `limit = 85` and `jitter 0`. |

lag-1 against pass count from the reference cycle at `n = 300`, `sigma = 0`:

```
passes    0     1     2     3     4     8    16    32    60   200
lag-1  +0.48 -0.09 +0.01 +0.05 +0.13 +0.27 +0.29 +0.07 -0.27 -0.74
```

It is *not monotone*. The dip in the first few passes is the entry dive forming, which is
legitimate structure; the decay after ~16 passes is the chatter. Under `sigma = 0.1` the early
dip stays above 0.2 (+0.32, +0.42, +0.57, +0.53), which is what makes an absolute floor usable
as a stopping rule -- it catches the degeneracy without firing on the transient.

Nearly all the honest gain is early: `dJ` runs 21.50, 21.54, 21.58, 21.77 at 0, 4, 32 and 200
passes. The last 0.2 blocks is bought entirely with chatter.

### Continuation compounds

A warm-started cell inherits its neighbor's polish, so a per-cell pass budget accumulates along
the continuation path. Measured on `n = 300 -> 310 -> 320` at 8 passes each:

```
lag-1  +0.73  +0.59  -0.07
TV      293    361    600
```

Degenerate by the second hop. A pass budget cannot bound this; a property of the schedule can,
which is what `--lag1-floor` is for. It stops a polish that crosses the floor and *discards the
crossing pass* -- on that same `n = 320` cell it stops at 2 passes with lag-1 +0.217, TV 505,
and `dy` 19.02 against the unguarded 18.91. The discarded passes were buying chatter, not
height.

## The entry is under-determined

Splicing three very different entries (ticks 0-24) onto one shared tail moves `J` by 0.047
blocks total -- reference 21.942, an extreme dip 21.989, a gentler one 21.947 -- and the choice
of tail changes nothing (3.5e-5). The entry is a flat plateau, consistent with the 5.8e-7
curvature and 2.0-degree half-width measured in `README-myopic.md`. So an entry that looks
alarming is not necessarily wrong, and imposing smoothness there costs almost nothing.

More generally: the dive's score is 15x flatter than the gain's and the entry's flatter still,
while the snap is ~3000x more pitch-sensitive. **Any analysis reading pitch differences between
cells as signal has to check the `J` difference first.** Convergence is tested on `J`, never on
pitch.

## Running it

```
sweep polish --n 300 --lambda 0 --vy 0 --vz 0 --jitter 0.10 --draws 8 \
             --passes 8 --tol 0 --lag1-floor 0.2 --flight algebraic \
             --anchor <file> --out <file>
sweep run    --out <dir> --ns <list> --lams <list> --vys <list> --vzs <list> [--shard i,j]
sweep verify <file>...
sweep fingerprint
```

`--mu <price>` is the l1 curvature price and is the current chatter regularizer; `runs/atlas`
was built at `--mu 1e-4 --limit 85`. The `--jitter` shown above is the older generation's
regularizer and current runs set it to 0 -- see the table further up.

A shard is one `(vy0, vz0)` cell, so it is a directory and an independent job. Inside a shard,
continuation runs breadth-first over the `(n, lambda)` plane from the cell nearest `n = 300`,
`lambda = 0`; `--anchor` seeds that one cell from a file. This matters: at `v0 = 0` the built-in
policy seed lands degenerate (lag-1 -0.19 at 8 passes) where the reference cycle gives +0.73,
and the anchor propagates to the whole shard. Once the `v0 = 0` shard exists, anchor the
nonzero-velocity shards on its *solved* `n = 300, lambda = 0` cell rather than on the raw
reference file: it is the nearest solved point, so continuation starts closer and is less
likely to pick a bad branch.

Resume is by file existence -- a cell whose file matches `(n, lambda, v0, trig, flight)` is not redone
but still seeds its neighbors, so a killed job costs at most one cell.

`--flight reference|algebraic` selects the movement kernel. `reference` remains the default;
`algebraic` routes yaw-zero movement through the collapsed equations and falls back to the
reference path for nonzero yaw. Profiles and manifests record the route, and resume also
requires it to match.

**A seed does not carry its route, so a mismatched one is refused.** `--init` and `--anchor`
take only the pitches; the route stays whatever `--trig`/`--flight` say, defaults included.
Seeding from an `mth_lut`/`algebraic` profile while the process sits on `libm`/`reference`
therefore solves a different problem than the seed solved, and nothing downstream can see it --
every header truthfully records the route it was actually run under, so the files come out
self-consistent and quietly wrong about which question they answer. It is not a rounding
detail: re-polishing one `runs/atlas` cell under the defaults took 186 passes and landed on
fixed point (0.415215, 0.330157) where its own route takes 156 and lands on
(0.415055, 0.330120).

So it is a hard error, with no override flag: matching the seed is what `--trig`/`--flight` are
for, and cross-route seeding has no legitimate use. The escape hatch for the rare case that
wants it already exists -- a headerless pitch list claims no route and is accepted as-is. On an Apple arm64 test machine, a representative `dp` transition-table
build fell from 0.121 seconds to 0.057 seconds (2.12x); the generated value table and schedule
were byte-identical.

That 2.12x was measured before pitch trigonometry was cached, and caching has since taken most
of it back -- `PitchTrig` hoists the sin/cos out of *both* routes, and eliminating that trig was
most of what the algebraic route was winning. What is left is three divisions and a sqrt per
tick, and whether removing them pays depends on the machine. Measured on `sweep polish`, one
n=300 cell at 30 passes, single core:

```
                          reference   algebraic
  Apple M5 (arm64)           7.15 s      7.98 s     algebraic 1.12x SLOWER
  Intel i7-6700 (Skylake)   14.11 s      6.93 s     algebraic 2.04x faster
```

On Skylake f64 division is long-latency and poorly pipelined, so dropping three of them per
tick is worth 2x; on the M5 division is cheap and the extra branches the collapsed form needs
(`vel.x == 0.0`, `is_sign_negative`) cost more than they save. So pick the route for the
machine: `reference` on arm64, `algebraic` on the cluster. Both are recorded in the header, and
`verify` replays under the route the file claims, so a corpus may mix them without ambiguity --
though a single corpus is easier to reason about if it does not.

Check a corpus with `python3 tools/check.py <dir>`; read profiles from Python with
`tools/load.py`.

**What `runs/corpus` actually is.** It was built in four phases -- the `n` axis at stride 10,
then `lambda` at `n` stride 50, then the velocity corners, then `lambda` at those corners --
over `n = 100..600` and `lambda = -4..4` stride 0.25, with `--trig libm` and
`--passes 8 --tol 0 --jitter 0.10 --draws 8`. **The lag-1 floor was off** (`--lag1-floor -2`,
below the -1 a correlation can reach), so every cell ran all 8 passes; all 509 profiles read
`(8 passes)`, which is how you can confirm it from the corpus alone. That is worth stating
because the synopsis above shows `--lag1-floor 0.2` and the section on degeneracy argues for
it: the guard is the recommendation, it is not what produced this corpus, and a re-run with it
on would not be comparable. The per-phase manifests record the cells of each phase:
`manifest_a_n.json`, `manifest_b_lambda.json`, `manifest_c_vel.json`.

## Steady state

`--steady` optimizes the cycle you would fly *back to back* instead of one cycle with the
terminal velocity free. It re-solves `v0` to the schedule's own fixed point -- the fixed point
of `v -> (replay the schedule from v).vel` -- after every pass, so at convergence `v_final ==
v0` identically and no constraint or penalty is needed to make the schedule repeatable.

Off by default. The single-cycle problem is the simpler object and is still the one most
questions are about.

**`--vy/--vz` change meaning under it.** They seed the fixed-point iteration rather than naming
the answer, so the profile's `v0` is whatever the schedule converged to and *that* is what the
header states.

So `v0` stops being a grid axis. A path names the coordinates that determine the answer, and a
seed that barely influences it is not one, so `run` writes steady cells under `steady/` instead
of a `vy.../vz...` shard and takes a single `--vys/--vzs` pair -- more than one is refused
rather than silently collapsed, since every shard would solve the same problems and race to
write the same files. Read `v0` from the header, as always.

Resume needs the same care: comparing objectives would never match, because a steady file's
`v0` is its own fixed point and not the cell's seed, and the whole grid would re-solve on every
resume while reporting success. It instead matches on horizon, lambda and price and then checks
that the file's stated `v0` really is the fixed point of its own pitches -- a property of the
file, so it is checked rather than trusted.

What it is worth, over 13 `runs/atlas/nsweep` cells at `lambda 0`, `mu 1e-4`, `limit 85`,
scoring each schedule at its own `v0` for one lap. The gain is U-shaped in `n`, not monotone:

```
n     150    176    200    226    250    276    300    326    350    376    400    426    450
gain +0.94  +0.80  +0.64  +0.38  +0.24  +0.13  +0.05  -0.00  -0.00  +0.01  +0.06  +0.18  +0.18
base  1.47   7.05  11.87  16.21  18.99  20.79  21.54  21.62  21.02  19.73  17.24  14.70  13.51
```

The minimum sits exactly where single-cycle `dTE` peaks. The schedules differ only in the
entry, the first 20-30 ticks, and the fixed point flips sign with horizon: `v0y` +0.415 at
`n = 150`, +0.030 at `n = 326`, -0.352 at `n = 426`. So steady state buys most where the
single-cycle answer is worst, and nothing where it is already good.

A `--steady` profile closes exactly, which is checkable from the file alone and is the point:
`examples/repeat` on one reads `sum|dv| 0.0000` on every lap.

## Portability

Vanilla's `Mth` sin LUT is ported and selectable with `--trig`, which removes the f32 trig
divergence between platforms (LLVM fuses standalone `sinf`/`cosf` into `___sincosf_stret` on
arm64, differing by 1 ULP on ~2.6% of inputs). `lift_force` still goes through f64 `cos`, so
bit-identity across platforms is **not** guaranteed; `sweep fingerprint` makes any drift a
measured number rather than a silent one. Compare it between machines before trusting output
from a new one.
