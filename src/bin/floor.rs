//! Flight over a floor: how long, and how far, before the trajectory first goes under `y = 0`.
//!
//! The polish only knows a fixed horizon, so endurance is a search over it: a horizon `n` is
//! *feasible* when some schedule keeps every one of its `n` post-tick states at or above the
//! floor, and the endurance is the largest feasible `n`. Inside one horizon the objective is the
//! usual `J = TE(s_n) + w*z_n` less the floor's price (see `Floor` in `opt.rs`); `J` only picks
//! which feasible schedule to hand the next horizon, and feasibility is read off the replay.
//!
//! Subcommands:
//!   probe                          constant-pitch baselines: glides, and ticks to the floor
//!   solve  --y0 <h> --n <n> [--init <spec>] [--out <file>]
//!   safety --y0 <h> --n <n> [--init <spec>]   max soft-min clearance: is this horizon feasible?
//!   endure --y0 <h> [--nmax <n>] [--misses <k>] [--out <file>]   the longest feasible horizon
//!   depth  --file <pitches> [--vy --vz]   how far a schedule dips below its start
//!   laps   --file <pitches> --y0 <h>   every dip and peak of the clearance before the exit, and
//!                                  the energy above the floor there: does a pump gain per lap?
//!   exit   --y0 <h> [--mode time|dist] [--n <cap>] [--nmax <cap>] [--init <spec>] [--ke <c>] [--shift]
//!          [--bubble <margin>,<weight>] [--shrink <r>] [--penalty l1|l2:<d>|huber:<d>]
//!          [--moves tick,box:<k>:..,ramp,shift] [--method tick|grad|grad+tick]
//!          [--iters <n>] [--mem <m>] [--max-step <deg>] [--c1 <c>] [--graze <blocks>,..]
//!                                  the interpolated first exit; the cap doubles while the
//!                                  answer survives it. `--method grad` is `ascend_grad`,
//!                                  gradient ascent on the exit score; the default is `ascend`
//!
//! Common options: --vy, --vz (initial velocity, default 0), --lambda (default 0),
//!   --margin, --weight, --wall (the floor's price), --mu, --limit, --passes, --tol.
//! An init spec is `hold:<p>`, `pump:<p_down>,<k>,<p_up>` (p_down for k ticks, then p_up),
//! `tile:<file>` (a cycle repeated), or a pitch file (last pitch repeated). `exit` also takes
//! `minipump[:<d>[,<k>]]`, see `minipump`, and `pumps:<K>[,<key>=<v>..]`, a K-climb
//! floor-grazing pump flown by events (keys `d lvl pull a a2 g end`; any not given is fitted to
//! the seed's own exit score), see `Pumps`.
//!
//! Physics is `mth_lut` trig and `reference` flight, fixed: vanilla's table, and the kernel
//! that is fastest on arm64 (README-sweep.md).

/// Two things the plain gradient cannot see, handled explicitly:
///
/// * **Pre-exit dips.** A local minimum of the clearance before the exit pair is a constraint
///   `h_j >= 0` that the score only feels by falling off a cliff when it breaks (a
///   touch-and-go). Unhandled, the ascent walks a dip onto the floor within a few dozen steps,
///   then every trial crosses it and the line search stalls there. So every dip under one block
///   contributes its own gradient `a_j = dh_j/dp` (one more backward sweep), and the direction
///   is projected onto `a_j . d >= margin - h_j`: to first order, a full step leaves the dip at
///   `margin` or above. The optimum therefore stands `margin` off the floor at its dips.
/// * **The forward-to-up switch at pitch 0.** The seed holds many pitches at exactly 0, where
///   the branch taken (off) has zero pitch-derivative, so the taken-branch gradient never lowers
///   them. `slopes` reports both one-sided derivatives there and `steepest` picks the side that
///   climbs.
