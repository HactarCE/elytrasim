///
/// Polished hard against a single exact trajectory, the optimizer finds a singular arc and
/// chatters between 0 and 90 degrees every tick through the late dive. That is not a numerical
/// artifact: at 90 degrees `cos(lean_angle)` is zero, so the lift force vanishes *and*
/// `look_hor_length` vanishes, which gates off both the descent-to-forward conversion and the
/// turning term. Bang-bang between "full aero" and "no aero" really does beat any fixed pitch
/// there -- and no human can fly it.
///
/// A slew-rate limit does not fix this, because the cycle contains genuine flicks: the snap
/// drops to 0 and the flick covers ~88 degrees in about six ticks. Any limit loose enough to
/// keep those is loose enough to keep the chatter.
///
/// Perturbing the *pitches* does not fix it either, and was measured: held-fixed draws made the
/// chatter worse (total variation 2406 against 3493), and per-pass resampling cut it only 29%
/// while costing 2.3 blocks of climb. The reason is that the schedule is not especially
/// sensitive to pitch at the chattering end -- `lift_force = cos^2(lean_angle)` is flat at 90
/// degrees, so a degree of pitch error there barely moves anything.
///
/// What works is perturbing the **initial velocity**. A knife-edge gain is knife-edge in the
/// *state*: it exists at one point in `(v_y, v_z)` and the tick that reaches it. Start from a
/// spread of velocities and no single schedule can sit on that point, because the draws arrive
/// at different states at every tick -- while a real flick, which is robust and merely has to
/// happen, keeps its value across the whole spread. This also states the honest problem: you do
/// not know your velocity to three decimals when you start a cycle.
///
/// **Superseded for chatter control, and off by default.** What is written above held when
/// stopping time was the only other lever: jitter suppresses chatter *only while the polish is
/// stopped early*, and polished hard it does nothing (`README-sweep.md` has the numbers -- total
/// variation is flat across an 8x range of `sigma` while `dz` falls monotonically). The l1
/// curvature price in `Rough` replaced it, because that one survives running to convergence.
/// Current runs set `sigma = 0` and carry `mu`; only `runs/corpus` and `runs/veljit`, the older
/// generation, were optimized at `sigma = 0.1`. Reach for this when the question really is
/// "does this schedule work from a starting velocity I do not know exactly", which is what it
/// measures and what it is still good for -- not when the question is chatter.
///
/// `sigma` 0.1 on each component is what this was settled on with, against a reference start of
/// about `(0.17, 0.20)` -- a perturbation of the same order as the velocity itself, so the
/// schedule is being asked to work over a genuinely wide basin rather than to be locally smooth.

///
/// ```text
///                       max|dp|  max|d2p|  p95|d2p|  sum|d2p|
/// reference cycle          38.3      37.9       0.4     147.1
/// hard-polished (chatter)  90.0     180.0     153.2    4211.1
/// ```
///
/// A factor of 4.7 at the max and 380 at the 95th percentile. The reference is a straight line
/// almost everywhere with a handful of corners -- its curvature is *sparse* -- which is why the
/// norm here is l1 and not l2. `sum |d2p|` with an l1 penalty is l1 trend filtering, whose
/// solutions are piecewise linear with adaptively placed breakpoints: it buys a corner wherever
/// one earns its keep and charges nothing for the straight runs between them. That is the shape
/// a hand produces, and it is the shape the reference cycle already has.
///
/// This is a *stated* term in the utility function, not a stopping rule. The point is that the
/// polish can then run to convergence: `mu` names the exchange rate between blocks of `J` and
/// degrees per tick squared of wrist, and the answer at that rate is a real optimum rather than
/// wherever the optimizer happened to be when it was interrupted.
///
/// **`Default` is not current practice.** It is `mu = 0, limit = 90` -- the *unpriced* objective,
